"""Cover-letter drafting against the Gemini API.

For each application the model writes a complete cover letter, tailored to
that posting, in the candidate's own voice. It gets three inputs:

  - the CV: the only source of facts about the candidate; nothing may be
    invented or embellished beyond it;
  - an example letter the candidate wrote themselves: the model matches its
    voice, tone, length, and structure;
  - the job posting: what the letter is tailored to.

This is a real generation step, so every draft is read, edited, and approved
by a human before anything is sent — see the workflow in web/api.py. This
module only produces text. The prompts themselves live in prompts.py.
