"""Candidate scoring profile.

Single source of truth for what counts as a good match. Scoring reads from
here; nothing else should carry candidate facts.

The profile lives in the database (``documents`` row ``scoring_profile``, as
JSON) so it can be tuned from the Profile page without editing code.
:data:`DEFAULT_PROFILE` is the seed used when that row is absent, and what
"Reset to defaults" restores.
